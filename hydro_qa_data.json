        "instruction": "How often should I harvest herbs? I have a few herbs growing hydroponically (basil, chives, cilantro) that are about 4 weeks old.  Right now they are about 4-5\" tall and have a health glow and smell to them.  The herbs are being held at a continuous temperature, light, and nutrient level indoors, so essentially the \"season\" never changes for them. \nAssuming that I always have a need for fresh herbs and therefore want to keep my plants alive as long as possible for continuous harvesting, when is it OK to start harvesting them and how often should I?  Is there a certain height/number of leaves recommendation (harvest a quarter of the leaves at a time, half the leaves at a time, etc.)?  Is there a general rule for most leafy herbs that apply for harvesting? \n",
        "response": "Herbs (and leaf vegetables in general) must be harvested regularly and not left to mature too much or too soon. Here are a few tips to harvesting herbs \u2014 mostly paraphrased from these two answers of mine \u2014 that'll help you keep a good availability of herbs for most of the year.\nHarvest the young leaves\nThere's a reason why grocery stores only sell the young leaves of herbs \u2014 the flavorful herbs as we know it are the young leaves of the plant. At this stage in the plant's life, its sole purpose is to grow and as such, the leaves are wider, lush, tender and rich in the aromatic stuff that we love. Once you have a bunch of young leaves (or when the plant is 6\" high), you can start harvesting it a few stalks at a time.\nWhen the plants reach maturity, its focus is to reproduce and die. So the new sets of leaves it produces are a lot thinner and in general, less aromatic (sometimes gets bitter). This is very commonly seen in cilantro, parseley and mint (and less so in rosemary and thyme).\nIf you need more, plant more!\nIf your culinary needs require larger amounts of cilantro, don't chop off the entire bunch or a lot of leaves at once, because the plant needs its leaves to photosynthesize and grow. My rule of thumb is that no more than 1/6th of the plant should be harvested at a time. Instead, have two plants and take off a 1/6th from each. You can scale this up and plant more as per your needs.\nIf you follow such a cycling scheme between sets of plants, you'll automatically be trimming the plant, keeping it forever young and by the time you've reached the last plant in your set, the first will be ready to harvest \u2014 this way, no plant is overworked.\nPrevent bolting at all costs \u2014 pinch the flowers!\nIf you notice any flowers growing/flower buds, pinch them off. Remember that a plant's \"mission\" is to reproduce before it dies, to ensure the survival of its species (producing flowers is the first step). If you let it go to flower (also called bolting), the plant, satisfied that it has successfully produced a flower, might decide to stop growing and focus instead on developing that flower into a fruit and eventually a seed.\nHowever, when you remove the flowers you're sort of \"tricking\" the plant into thinking that its previous mission has failed (i.e., it hasn't produced a flower to ensure its survival). This in turn encourages the plant to produce even more leaves for food production (and flowers). However, this will only prolong the life of the plant by a few months.\nBasil and cilantro are notorious for \"bolting\" and this answer of mine shows how to remove the flowers (it's really easy). Typical indicators of a plant that has bolted or is in advanced stages, is the presence of flowers, woody stalks and thin, possibly bitter leaves. At this point, its better to let it go to seed and harvest the seeds for spice (in the case of cilantro) or simply start a fresh one while this dies.\nPlant only what you know you'll use\nI know, it's tempting to be able to grow all possible herbs so that you can use it whenever you need them. However, if you're not prepared to use them up (or share with friends/neighbours) at the same speed as they grow \u2014 i.e., if you use them sparingly \u2014 it might be a better idea to not plant them in the first place. They'll simply die without being used and most likely, you might end up only needing it when it is at a mature stage, hence spoiling your experience with the out-of-flavour leaves.\n",

        "instruction": "How much lighting do I need for growing lettuce using indoor hydroponics? I am beginning to get into indoor hydroponics to grow lettuce, I haven't figured out which type of lettuce to grow yet, I am thinking of a butterhead. I have been to many hydroponics stores and seen almost all the lettuce hydroponics videos on youtube. When it comes to lighting, no one has an accurate answer. The store is trying to push a huge T5 lighting system. But I think its overkill. Now I have bought a Light Meter, to test various lights.\nHow many lumens do I need for lettuce to grow?\nI'm trying to figure out the costs involved with the electricity of the lights.\n",
        "response": "The reason you are not finding the answer you are looking for in regards to the lumen requirements of crops is that lumens is a measurement for humans.  It is based on the level of light that we can perceive.  \nPlants mostly require light in wavelengths of around 430,450,650,675 nano meters (depending on the crop), with highly varied intensity requirements from crop to crop.  Lettuce requires mostly the high end of the blue spectrum of light, 650-700 nm, at an intensity of 17 mols/m2/day of PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation).  If you do some research you may be able to find the manufacturers data sheets for certain lights, which may include this information, although you may have to contact the manufacturer for more in depth answers.  \nThe reason why lumens are a bad indicator for determining light requirements of plants is that the light plants need most is almost out of the visible spectrum for humans.  Manufacturers of indoor lighting will try and target 555 nm because the photopic conversion (lumens/watt) is 683 lm/w at this wavelength, while light that plants need has a very small photopic conversion (430 nm is only 8 lm/w, 650 nm is 73 lm/w).  A 100W plant light (we'll assume 100% efficiency for math purposes) could be producing only 4000 lumens, while a 100W human light would be 68300 lumens.  \nFinancially though, you are better off using a high volume manufactured light (common bulbs) that is producing a lot of light you don't really need, but is producing a small percentage of the light you actually do need.  If you use fluorescent tube or CFL lights, I have used both, you should aim for about 1500-2000+ lumens per square ft. with a Kelvin rating of 6500K.  The cheapest way to do it is wire your own panel using keyless lamp holders and bulk buying the CFL's.  Discard the bulbs after 6 months or less, as the spectrum of light your plants need will decrease.  Use 1, 23W CFL (100W equalivant), 6500K bulb per plant.\n",

Instead of soil, the plant is placed in water.\nAre there any advantages to growing plants hydroponically? \nAre there instances where plants can grow faster if they are grown hydroponically?\n",
        "response": "There are a few 'advantages' to growing plants via hydroponics.  It is mostly just a way to grow plants in a different environment (indoors, or in a non-native environment).  Just like growing vegetables in a greenhouse wouldn't per se be 'better' than growing them in a field.  There are advantages to both: a greenhouse allows you to grow things that aren't naturally suited to your environment, whereas a field would allow you to a much larger quantity of plants per cost.  Hydroponic is just another way to suit a person's tastes/needs in a growing environment.  \nHere are a few things hydroponics can accomplish or accomplish easier than other methods:\n\nControl over nutrient uptake (can adjust in water supply)\nGrow plants indoors without the use of natural light\nNo hassle with soil setup and testing\nGenerally weed free environment (if done indoors)\nMore plants can fit into a smaller space\nEasier harvesting\n\nThere is some debate as to growth speed and nutrient retention.  Generally, grow speed is faster in a hydroponic system.  This is somewhat due to the increased nutrients supplied in a water supply and the roots of a plant can directly absorb them.  However, in a soil based system, if a fertilizer or nutrient is applied regularly it can have the same effect so just because the system is hydroponic in nature, doesn't necessarily mean your yield will always be more.  \nHere are a few disadvantages over more conventional growing methods:\n\nNo soil buffer.  If the hydroponics system fails, plants will die much faster.\nIncreased energy cost (if using growth lights and air pumps)\nWater-based pathogens can be easily introduced\nMore complex handling/tracking of nutrient solutions\nMuch higher cost to start up system compared to traditional methods (need to purchase nutrients and supplements to keep plants alive)\n\nJust a note: hydroponics isn't necessarily growing plants in water, a substrate may still used (such as perlite or fired clay pellets).  The difference is that the plant is not absorbing any nutrients from the substrate, it's getting it all from the water.\nSources\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics#Advantages\nhttp://www.hydroponics-simplified.com/advantages-of-hydroponics.html\n",

        "response": "Given the previous answer, which covers hydroponic growing, I'll just add an explanation of how it's possible to over water a plant which is growing in potting compost, and thereby cause plant death or disease.\nThe key is in the word 'clean' - hydroponics requires clean water, principally. When a plant has its roots in soil or compost, this isn't clean in the same way. The planting medium is full of bacteria, fungal spores and a wealth of other micro organisms and bio diversity, most of which are supportive of the plant's growth. If you leave this pot with its plant sitting in water permanently, the conditions in the soil change, usually from life supporting to toxic in some way. Gas exchanges are affected, some bacteria multiply and others simply die, and fungal spores may overgrow, thus providing a very toxic environment for the plant trying to survive with its roots in that soil. This is not true of all plants - some grow very well in soggy, wet soil, but the vast majority do not.\n",

        "response": "CFL is compact fluorescent lighting. It's basically a low energy using spiraly bulb. You can grow with them and you're correct that you would probably want at least one each of the 2700k and 6500k bulbs. These numbers are referring to the colors the bulb is putting out. One is going to be a warmer color and will be your reds and the other will be the colder colors and light in the blue spectrum. \nIf I remember correctly, plants only need the red and blue spectrums. I read somewhere that if you only have one, use the 6500k.\nSo you can definitely use these as grow lights and usually come out cheaper, because they aren't labeled as special \"grow\" bulbs. You can buy the special grow bulbs and they may cover both of these spectrums in on bulb. Or maybe they're a long bulb so you can cover a greater area. There are charts as to how high any light bulb needs to be above the plant and how large a radius it's recommended to cover. \nThere is another type of bulb I've never used called 'metal halide'. They are supposed to be good bulbs and are used in large grow houses, but they're expensive and dangerous. They get searingly hot. Not only can this burn your plants, but you as well. \nAn alternative to the CFL bulbs are the LED bulbs they're starting to come out with. The light looks purple, because it's alternating straight blue and straight red lights. It gives it a pinkish purple haze. I think I read somewhere, though, that while these are great for plants, they aren't great for human eyes.\nThis will give you something to look into and hopefully point you in the right direction to learn more about your lighting sources. I'd personally stick with the CFL bulbs, because they are low energy and give off very little heat. Just look at the charts on the internet to see how many you need for a given number of plants.

It will also have the ability to email you if the light does not kick on when it should.\nThe point I was trying to get to here is I would like to know what you guys think are the most important feature of systems like this?  What types of things is it most important to you that it can control?  I am also working on building a client for the system that will show the current status of sensors/appliances, will have graphs with live data showing environmental stats of the grow room and all sort of other things.  I'm working to make this as user-friendly and cheap as possible so that any home user who doesn't want to drop $2000 on a system that just monitors humidity and temp can afford to automated much of their tasks in the grow room.  I would also like to give the system the ability to change out the water in my hydroponics system and handle ph balancing and nutrient dosages but that is a very long-term goal. Let me know what you guys think and thanks in advanced for any feedback!\n",
        "response": "A clean, sterile one use only room for growing anything.  The greenhouse environment is more forgiving, the garden can make anyone look successful.  Ventilation pumping in and out or a great thermodynamic cool and warm air system.  The best soil...potting soil for any plant sequestered with sides and education or adding decomposed organic matter to make garden soil better each year.  Drainage is as important as water and C02 to plants.  Best place to start a design.  Artificial lighting or the ability to grow in the greenhouse if you have the proper length season.  Stability...to be able to monitor and control the atmosphere, temperature, humidity and keep it from any drastic changes.  Did I say ventilation?  Your plants should be physically moving if you have enough ventilation or movement of air.  On top of that is air coming in and leaving the room.  One thing that you should consider is pollen from neighbors growing out of doors.  Soon that will become a larger problem.  For instance, growing corn near a GMO field will mean that any seed of that corn will be GMO.  Lots of pollen of species you won't know and sometimes fertilized female flowers will reduce the crop and its quality.\nThe best 'appliance' of all is just YOUR PARTICIPATION.  Once you are able to be successful manually then it is time to add technology.  I am serious.  There is no way automation should be done without an expert in the background controlling those dials and meters.  We all have to learn the hardway.  It is costlier to jump too far beyond one's skills at the beginning than it is when you keep everything straightforward and simple.  As well as enjoying far more success. \nTwo books you have to have; Shane Smith's Greenhouse Gardening and Jorge Cervantes Cannabis Encyclopedia!  Using these two books should vastly increase success whether growing in soil or growing in water.\n",

My 13 year old grandson wants to grow some Fly Traps using this  small, inexpensive, boxed hydroponic kit. \n\nThe kit is designed for kids 12 years and older. The parts are all plastic. It comes with seeds, planting cubes, nutrients and a Hydro-Pump. In the description, it says:\n\nSimply follow the planting instructions and see sprouts within a month. Fly Traps are easy and fun to grow, and best yet, will keep your house free of worrisome flies and other flying encroaching insects. \n\nAccording to their website, the company is dedicated to providing products that are both educational and fun for children of all ages. The company looks reputable, but I also found the same kit at a large seller, and the majority of reviews were very negative. Of course, reviews can't always be trusted. \nThis isn't a brand or price request. I'm just hoping someone knows about this type of product, and whether or not they have statistically good success rates. You can assume he would carefully follow instructions, and take good care of it. \nI want to be clear that he's not interested in becoming what he calls a \u201creal\u201d gardener.  He just wants to have a little fun, and grow plants that eat bugs.  My daughter doesn't want to buy him anything big, or spend a lot of money.

        "response": "I don't disagree with Giacomo's post, except for the quantity of bugs they eat, but I can tell you a little more about this subject.\nCarnivorous plants are a lot of fun and can be easy to keep. I know that I killed several until I found some good advice. I think I started out with a venus fly trap (VFT) and based on internet advice, I put it outside in the summer (the only thing it got right), watered it like a house plant, and set it on a tray filled with gravel to create humidity. It even suggested I make a super weak solution of miracle grow and brush ONLY the underside of a few leaves with a cotton swab dipped in this solution.\nOne of the best resources I found for the care of any plant is a book called \"The Savage Garden\" by Peter D'Amato.\nIt tells you about where the plants come from, growing requirements, how to make appropriate soil, etc... Between that book and a site called Terraforums.com, I've found a ton of helpful advise and have had great success with my carnivorous plants (CPs).\nI believe VFTs are very easy to care for. Granted that's due in part to me living in SC, where they originate, so it's easier for me, but they can be grown in other locations with a little work.\nSo the kit you're talking about, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. I picked up a couple to test this spring, but from what I've read, the issue is that CP seeds have a short shelf life and these kits can sit in warehouses and on shelves for long periods of time. The good news is that most people say they contacted the company that makes it, tell them that no seed germinated and that they'd like replacements seeds, and the company sends them out. I guess it's a frequent thing. It seems to me a better business model would be like with ant farms, where you buy the kit and send off for the ants/plants.\nEven if you have viable seeds, then plants like VFTs and Sarracenia need a winter dormancy for their seeds. The kits usually say something like moisten the included soil, place the seeds on top of the soil, cover with the dome, and stick in the fridge for 6 weeks.\nA better idea might be to just buy a mature plant. I frequently see them in big box stores in the spring. They come in little clear plastic boxes affectionately know as death cubes. One site I had particularly good luck ordering from was PredatoryPlants.com. I've ordered from a few others, but I had the best quality plants and the best customer service from these guys. You're welcome to order from anywhere you choose, though. I'm sure you can get good plants from anywhere.\nThere are basically two type of CP's you can get. There are tropical ones like nepenthes. I think they're really cool and I'm currently getting my first pitchers on a small N. \"Lady Luck\" that I ordered. This is what a mature one looks like.\n\nThose are from tropical environments and the cold will kill them. If you have bright lights or windows and provide high humidity, those are good indoor plants. However, there isn't action, like with VFTs. They have pitchers that bugs fall into and can't get out of.\nThe other main category of CPs are ones that require a winter dormancy. VFTs and Sarracenia, which are mostly what I grow, fall into this category. If you decide to buy a VFT and keep it in the house, you should know that you'll have to provide it with a winter dormancy period. I've never had to do this myself because of where I live, but plenty of people do. They'll put them in the fridge, outside, etc... You can easily research it. If you don't give them this dormancy, they'll eventually die.\nJust to tell you how I keep them now, so you'll see how easy it can be, I pot them in a mix of play sand and peat moss. You can get both extremely cheap, more than you'd need for tons of plants. I plant them in cheap plastic pots that are tall and skinny.\n\nI get a cheap plastic tray and set them out on the front steps in full sun. All I ever do is keep the trays full of water year round and pick out any debris or stray seeds that fall in the top. That's it. They've gone gang-busters and I'm going to have to divide at least one this year. We see temps between 80-110 Fahrenheit. The pots freeze solid and thaw with no ill effect. They catch lots of bugs. The VFTs seem to catch a large number of daddy longlegs. The sarrs will get tubes so full they fall over sometimes. They'll catch a lot of wasps and things like that. Last year I bought a new, pretty sar, called S. Leucophylla \"Hurricane Creek White\" from the site I mentioned. It's doing well.\n\nI plant to make a bog garden this year. These plants are very neat and rewarding, so I hope you guys get one and have a lot of fun with it. Just read up on the plants, don't feed them anything but bugs, and for the most part they'll catch their own. They only have so many \"snaps\" in them before that leaf dies, so try not to play with them too much. They'll catch tons of bugs on their own. Mine always have at least two traps digesting bugs. \n",

        "response": "A terrestrial plant maintains a greater range of temperatures in the parts above ground (canopy), and usually lower and more stable temperatures below ground.  The same applies for aeroponics.  The root zone should be kept between 62\u00b0F - 71\u00b0F.  This is because the highest dissolved oxygen occurs at 68F (9ppm DO), and oxygen is transported inside the plant as dissolved oxygen even though the air roots might be exposed to higher oxygen levels.  However, it should be noted that some plants, such as lettuce, are less sensitive to levels of DO then other plants.\nThe canopy can be kept at higher temperatures. The leaf temperature range for fast growth is 72\u00b0 (minimum) to 86\u00b0F. As a rule of thumb plant growth approximately doubles for every 10\u00b0F rise.\n\nWithin limits, rates of photosynthesis and respiration both rise with increasing temperatures. As temperatures reach the upper growing limits for the crop, the rate of food used by respiration may exceed the rate at which food is manufactured by photosynthesis. For tomatoes, growth peaks at 96\u00b0F.[1]\n\nThe temperature may also need to be lowered when plants flower and fruit.  Chilling the nutrient solution also helps protect the plant against heat stress, and lower temperatures are used for cool climate plants.\nNote also that lighting has an effect on the plant.  LED lighting does not generates infra-red and so has no major effect on plant tissue temperatures, but HID lighting can raise tissue temperature by 5-7\u00b0F which is why it only appears that LED lighting is not as effective as high intensity discharge lighting. The effect of IR heating forms a gradient on the plant as distance increases from the light source.\nCO2 requirements rise with temperature, and enriching the grow room with CO2 does allow also for higher temperatures.\nAt night you can drop the temperature by 10\u00b0F from the day period.\n[1] http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/143.html#temp\n",

        "response": "Looks like root rot, probably caused by an oomycete called Phytophthora (genus). Wikipedia says:\n\nRoot rot can occur in hydroponic applications, if the water is not properly aerated. This is usually accomplished by use of an air pump, air stones, air diffusers and by adjustment of the frequency and length of watering cycles where applicable.\n\nThat is likely what happened here. Root rot only grows where there is too much moisture, causing anaerobic conditions. Hydrogen peroxide can help oxygenate the water and kill the fungus. From here:\n\nHydrogen peroxide is an unstable molecule, and when it breaks down, you get one water molecule and one oxygen atom. That's how it helps plant growth, as plant roots require oxygen, and H2O2 provides this, while also killing anaerobic infections such as what causes root rot during overwatering.\n\nWhile this helps, mechanical aeration of the water in your hydroponic system will help prevent this from happening in the future. Your plants look too far gone to get good success from cuttings, and because that's the only way to salvage the plants, it would be better to start fresh, with new plants.\n",

Then work your way up to 1/2 and stay there for awhile and see how it looks, then increase or decrease. Make sure to ph it correctly too. Also, im sure your aware, but just in case your not, those damaged leaves, will not get better. Look to new growth to judge how its doing. Also, be sure to correct your feeding if your giving it too much of something. Everything has to be in the right ratios. Calcium should be at a 7 to 1 ratio with magnesium.

I have a tent that is 38\"x38\"x6' and I was thinking maybe it was having a small fan that is running in there 24/7.

Fans are critical for all indoor and greenhouse plants.  Do not worry, moving air has few if any negative effects for your plants.  Unless the plant is being moved in the back of a truck going more than 30mph, now that is too much.\nPlants USE CO2 and give off O2.  The important thing is to get that O2 gas away from the leaves so that CO2 can move in to be available to the plant. As long as your room is not airtight, the air being sucked out will be replaced with fresh.  Lots of growers actually use heaters for instance that give off CO2 in their greenhouses.  Dry ice is another source to increase CO2 to increase plant production and vitality.  \nDepending on the plants you are growing, humidity is not a big deal breaker.  Consistency of heat, good soil and proper light are the critical factors.  Open that vent all of the way.  Air circulation regulates growth and curbs fungus.  If the vent is opened all the way and the temperature drops, close it down until the temperature is consistent.\nCucumbers in my experience do not do any better or worse for the humidity levels.

Pythium, Phytophthora and Rhizoctonia species are often referred to as water moulds as they are particularly well adapted to water borne dispersal with the first two having motile (swimming) zoospores as well as other spores and fruiting bodies that can be carried by water. The corky root fungus ( Pyrenochaeta lycopersici ) is not spread in NFT solutions, but Didymella lycopersici can be spread in NFT solutions, although such spread does not normally result in stem lesions (7). Most diseases caused by Fusarium species, and by some Verticilium species, and black dot disease of tomato roots (Colletotrichum sp.) appear to spread well through nutrient solutions, as do many bacterial and virus diseases. Nematodes are not general a problem in hydroponically grown food crops in NZ, but are readily spread in recirculating nutrient solutions.\n\nhttp://www.ghvi.co.nz/NFT/Disease_in_Hydroponics.html\n",

I need the system to be very compact with respect to height as I wish to have multiple systems in pods / trays, running different mixes of additives. The majority of information online is geared to a 'specific market', where space or the height of the pot does not seem to be a concern.

DWC is a more established method because in a shallow water system there are problems of maintaining balanced pH levels. However, the pH issue can be compensated for through constant monitoring and balancing of the nutrient solution.\nShallow water culture is gaining in favor because it\u2019s considered a more efficient use of space and nutrient solution. There is also more oxygen produced by the moving water of a shallow culture system through the air bubbles created as the water flows over the cuttings.\nIn shallow water culture, plant cuttings sit in a shallow tray with a constant flow of nutrient solution. Once a plant forms roots and matures, it can be moved into its more permanent growing tray or system.\n\n\nMy questions are:\nA) what would you suggest would be the easiest method to produce and run reliably?\n\n\nSoil for beginners, see if you have a green thumb.\n\nA pre-built, well reviewed, ready to use hydroponic system.\n\nLast choice: DIY, be prepared for problems.\n\n\n\nB) what would be the shallowest pot/vessel/container/tank that would work well? - I do have the option for a separate reservoir if that was required, as I would like to avoid daily maintenance if possible.\n\nHere's one set of plans: \"DIY Hydroponic PVC Pipe System\" (use the Aeroponic Conversion for better results, and more difficulty),if you move the resovoir out from underneath and put 4\" pipes on 2x4's the height will be less than 6\".

You're just wasting nutrients that the plants haven't had time to consume yet. Especially when your plants are small or your tank volume is large you may find that you can go much longer than 1 week.\n\nIn short, how long can I leave the same nutrients in my system for ? If the reading of my EC stays above a certain level can I just keep using them until it reaches around 1.7 then change the water and add new nutrients ?\n\nIt depends to some extent on the type of system you are running and certainly the volume of water. For tomatoes is deep water culture I prefer to use a relatively large tank (50L per plant) and to top off nutrients and water over time because it's less labor intensive and cheaper. In this case I will refill the tank until I have put about 75-100L of additional water into it (adjusting EC and pH as I do this) before draining.  If your plants are less salt tolerant than tomatoes, you will want to change more frequently.\n\nI understand that you should drain and start with new water every week or 2 but that wouldn't be needed if I was using the same nutrients and not adding anything more ?

Another method is running root hormone through your hydroponics system and rooting all of your cuttings at once the cutting will stay humid because it is a hydroponic system and the water evaporating keeps the plant green.

During day time, the plants take up nutrients, such as K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are all positive charged ions (cations). The roots compensate by releasing H+ ions, to keep the positive and negative ions in equilibrium, this causes the pH to decrease during day time. At night the uptake is stopped, and the pH will increase. You can find more about this here. I hope it helps!\n",

But I'd like to know if it's possible to transplant it into dirt as it's getting too tall for my aquaponic setup, and if so, the method.\n\n",
        "response": "Yes, of course.\nHowever, you will likely need to stake it until the roots are stabilized in the ground. In case you aren't familiar with this, put two stout poles in the ground on opposite sides of the tree and perpendicular to the line of the normal wind direction. I like the rubber ties that look chain-like, but you can use just about any convenient ties as long as you take care that it doesn't abrade the bark on the trunk. You should progressively loosen these constraints so the tree increasingly has to stand on its own. The tree should be capable of standing on its own and the support removed before fall (2016).\nI caution you about planting it too deeply. The root collar should be at the ground level and not below it. Planting too deeply can suffocate the roots, killing the tree. Just dig an area deeply enough to accomplish these ends. Sit the tree in, spread the roots out evenly, and cover with the topsoil you removed to make the hole.\n",

        "response": "Short answer No,\nDetailed answer - Here are the reasons why you should not use it for hydroponics\n\nThese fertilizers are designed to be used in soil. They are slow releasing and the rate of release of individual nutritional element is not consistent.\n\nMostly it uses Ammoniacal source of Nitrogen. Yes it can be consumed by plants directly but it is very poisonous even in slightly higher concentration. This source of nitrogen is designed to be broken by bacteria in soil first which does not happen in hydroponics. Mostly in hydroponics nitrates are used as source of nitrogen. Mostly calcium nitrate and potassium nitrate.\n\nIt is very difficult to achieve desired concentration of nutritional elements with this kind of mix resulting into deficiency of some elements.\n\nThe micronutrients are in form of oxide, notice the \"O\" in the formula. This type of micronutrients have issues with ion exchange and will result in complex salts which cannot be used by plants.\n\n\nI guess this company also makes water soluble fertilizers\nhttp://hadaflevel.com.sa/#!/Straight-Fertilizers\nyou can check this out.

        "response": "You're definitely missing something; your information is incomplete. You've  mentioned evaporation (from the soil, presumably)  but not transpiration. Plants need water, it's the  stuff of life - they need it for the process of transpiration and carbon exchange, they need it to keep plant tissues hydrated via the xylem and phloem, they need it for the transport of nutrients and without it, photosynthesis doesn't take place. Think of the xylem and phloem system as vaguely like our veins and arteries - if you deprived a human being of water and other fluids for a week, dehydration and death would quickly follow. And the same is true of plants; in fact, I would consider water as number one on the list of a plant's requirements, above all else, though obviously, some plants have adapted to store fluid so their requirements are lower (cacti for instance). Expecting plants to carry out all the processes of life without water is like expecting a non electric car to run without petrol (or gas, depending where you are).

Unfortunately, the pH drops drastically to a level of 4, which is not good for my plants\u2026\nSo, in 1 L RO water, I added Potassium Bicarbonate (KHCO3) as a buffer and make the solution to 90 ppm (128,6 \u00b5S/cm). This brought the pH to 7,86. Then, after half an hour I added the Nutrient Solution. 935 \u00b5L Nutri Forte A (specification attached to the comment) + 935 \u00b5L Nutri Forte B (specification attached to the comment). I stirred it. At the moment the EC showed 1203 \u00b5S/cm (1,203 mS/cm) and pH was 7,13. I added 80 \u00b5L Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) to adjust the pH. I stirred it.

Some growers claim that for some crops you can allow the pH to drop to 4 without a problem. So the key is to watch the crop for signs of deficiencies and take that as a sign for action rather than aiming for a numeric pH level.\n",

It's recommended in every source I found, but as it's growing absolutely great at the moment,  why should I change it?\nWill I kill the plant by keeping it in just water?\n",
        "response": "No.\nI realize this is an old question, but it needs a proper answer.\nPlumeria is highly susceptible to root rot and will die if you attempt to grow it without potting it in soil. In order for you to have had what success you have apparently had, the cutting itself would have had to have been sanitized (usually required by customs laws when transporting plants internationally) and your current environment would have to be relatively free of fungal agents such as active fungal growth or spores anywhere nearby.\nGenerally, even in these circumstances, Plumeria will still develop root rot and eventually stem rot and die. You should check your plant for stem rot by pressing with your fingers around the stem from roots to tip; the entire stem should be very firm to the touch with no give or softness at all.\nEven if you are miraculously successful at continuing to grow the cutting without planting it, it will outgrow its container within a couple months. When properly taken care of, Plumeria grows quickly and it can grow big - 3-4 meters tall and several meters spread; it's an actual tree, not a house plant.\nI recommend that you plant the cutting immediately in a well-drained non-acidic non-saline soil. A 50/50 mix of potting mix and perlite is a good starting point. Pot size depends upon how big you're willing to let it grow. As it grows, you'll want to keep a close eye on it for pests (I have particular trouble with spider mites) and disease. When it starts to get too big, you can take a cutting and root it and start another plant. You can also cut off the ends of a stem or branch to induce branching. You should fertilize it every so often, especially if you want it to flower. Plumeria is full sun and you'll want as much extra light as you can put on it. If you keep it well lit in a warm environment it will continue to grow year round. You probably aren't the only person in your area trying to grow one, so look online for local Plumeria garden clubs for tips specific to your locale.\nPlumeria is a very pretty plant, but it takes a lot of attention and care. \n",

However, I find in my attempts that no matter how clean my tools and water are, the wounds on the cuttings (where I've made the cut, and where I have removed leaves) begin to turn black and rot within a couple of days of being submerged in water. I have been changing the water every 1-2 days. My cuttings now have roots, but the rotting is still progressing, and I will probably have to pot them soon to stop the rot taking over. \nI was wondering if anyone has had success growing cuttings in still water for more than a couple of months, and in your case, what did you do to stop the rot from developing?\n",
        "response": "Of course Hydroponics growers do this all the time, growing plants in liquid medium, but they take special care to provide a suitable environment. First the liquid contains nutrients specially balanced to feed the cuttings. Second there is are special measures to ensure that the roots have access to air. This can be done a couple of ways, first by increasing the air dissolved in the water and second by having long roots partly in air and partly in the liquid medium.\nIn theory you can have just cuttings in plain water - the growing tips will then steal nutrient from the lower parts of the cuttings causing those leaves and shoots to die off, and while this can go on for a while eventually you end up with a mess. Water may start off aerated to some degree but will soon become stagnant unless replaced regularly with fresh.\nI have some willow cuttings in plain water which have been surviving for about 3 months. In this case they don't mind having roots entirely underwater for a while but as the water level drops due to transpiration so some roots find air until I fill up again. Nutrients are stolen from the woody cuttings and so no real rot is visible, but at the same time they don't make the kind of top growth that their cousins out in the field achieve.\nProbably the key to preventing rot is to choose as woody material as you can find, then there is little to rot. It will be a case of balancing hardness with ability to produce roots, which is probably why mint is a good candidate.\n",

Obviously you should be checking your pH - if your pH is too high your plants will not be taking up iron in the right amounts, so that's a relatively easy thing to fix.  Also, if your solution is cold you might not have a good root system in the tomato plants - check to make sure there are plenty of good white root fibers, and you may need to warm up your solution a bit if that is the problem.\nIf your problem is nitrogen related, you can probably compensate by adding more potassium nitrate or calcium nitrate (although still check pH - it affects the uptake of all nutrients), as hydroponic plants can tolerate a high nitrogen ppm (do not ever use ammonium nitrate in a hydroponic system, as this will kill your plants once the ammonium builds up as there's no soil bacteria to process it).\n",

        "response": "How can you get started growing crops? Do you need any licenses for that?\nA good starting point will be to contact your county Agricultural Extension office. They should be able to answer your questions about licensing, and point you in the direction of other resources you'll find helpful.\nAeroponics is done \"indoors\" but that can mean inside a temporary structure like a hoophouse, or it can mean inside a permanent building. If you plan to renovate an existing building, you may need permits for that. If you plan to build a new building, you'll definitely need permits for that. Contact your local (city/town) government for building permits. You'll also need to figure out what your water supply will be. Will you use municipal drinking water? A nearby stream, river or reservoir? Each source probably has its own permitting requirements.\nHow can you distribute your crops to the needy? What licenses will you need for that?\nThere are lots of ways to distribute food to people who need it. First look around for organizations in your area that are giving away food, like food pantries, churches and other organizations that provide free meals, meals on wheels, etc. Contact them and ask if they will take your produce. They should be able to tell you what their requirements are, eg whether they need you to have some kind of certification or license.\n\nThe Collaborative for Fresh Produce\nFeeding Texas\n\nHow can you sell your crops to raise funds to grow and distribute more crops?\nYou may be able to sell produce to your local school. Check out Texas' Farm to School program for more info.\nYou can sell produce directly to consumers at farmers markets. The organizer of your local farmers market should be able to advise you on what kind of licensing you'll need for that. Some farmers markets have a system that allows recipients of SNAP and WIC to use those programs to buy produce. If you can sell at one of those markets, you'll hit both your goals of distributing produce to people in need and raising funds to support your organization.\n\nTexas Farmers Market Food Access Program\n\n\nWhen you're starting a program from scratch like this, the amount of things that you don't know can seem overwhelming. Even more, there are things that you don't yet know that you need to know. Here's some general advice.\n\nMake a list of \"things you don't know\" that you need to know. Add to the list as you go along.\n\nFind other organizations that have done something similar to what you're trying to do. Contact them and ask how they got started.\n\nWhenever you can, talk to an actual person on the phone rather than online or by email. If the only contact info available is email, send a concise email with your main goal/question, but mention that you would love to talk to someone on the phone; provide your phone number.\n\nAsk for advice, and if they say \"I don't know,\" ask, \"do you know anyone who might know? How can I contact that person?\" Then contact that next person and get their advice.\n\nThere are lots of federally-funded grant programs for the type of work you're trying to do. You may be able to get some grant funding to buy equipment or pay for your time while you work on getting this off the ground.

        "response": "I can answer a few of your questions and definitely give you my opinions, grins!\nNO you should not take plants grown in soil and grow them further hydroponically.  Roots grown in soil are different than roots grown in water.  Sort of like starting an Avocado seed in water then transferring it to soil.  Yes, it can be done but one avocado seed is easier than a whole garden of plants grown in soil then put in water. \nMy opinion on hydroponics.  People say that plants grow faster and better, etc. I believe them. I know how to grow plants in soil.  Not hydroponically.  I like knowing I am doing the au natural thing plants understand and need.  I am a frickin' expert and I see hydroponics as mind numbing technology to grow plants in an unnatural way. This assumes we humans know plants well enough to recreate what they need, what their genetics expect and demand without once making a mistake.  On that subject, I KNOW us humans have a long ways to go to be able to KNOW plants and their needs.\nOne mistake the whole mess is a done deal and have to start over.  I love knowing that one mistake growing in soil won't kill the entire kit and kaboodle.  One plant in trouble gives me an indicator to save the rest.  Beginners such asI am assuming you are should stick with learning how to grow in soil before ever attempting to grow in OTHER than soil. I have used the artificial grow mediums and hated them.  There will be other answers from those who swear by hydroponics and have used hydroponics but I'll bet they all started with soil based first.  I don't see ever using hydroponics in my future.  I am of the club that humans are just stupid and arrogant, grins, to think we know how to grow plants better that the way they were designed.  Hey, hydroponics is a big deal and successful as well, but I haven't been impressed.  Growing hydroponically is a good 'stretch' for experienced gardeners but a disaster for newbies.  That is my opinion.\nPolyvinyl crystals I've seen used in soil are flat out dumb.  Automatic irrigation is better.  Best is manual watering that allows one to visually and tactically know what your plants need...if we don't understand how to grow plants in soil why the heck would we try to grow hydroponically?  \nIf you have become proficient with growing in soil then it shall be a good experiment to grow hydroponically.  I give you my blessing and admiration.  I've read tons on this subject yet I am just not convinced enough to make a system that is completely reliant on mesef.  Good ole soil I understand.  And still the responsibility is huge.\nDealing with people (the bulk of our populations) who know nothing about plants, includes the idea that plants are like animals. For example; MOST people actually think fertilizer is food.  All the weird yummy sounding fish fertilizers, coffee grounds and other additives are mostly to assuage guilt and ignorance of plants.  Plants make their own food.  We are relegated to supply the chemicals we've stripped from our soils, to make subsoils into topsoils with the addition of decomposed organic matter and SMALL additions of macro NPK chemicals and micro chemicals (Boron, magnesium, molybdenum, sulfur, iron, calcium and MORE)  I say CHEMICALS instead of nutrients because dog gone it, people think of these chemicals as food.  And us humans think food is good.  The more the better.  Which is totally NOT TRUE and usually fatal with plants...sigh.\nIf you know how to grow plants in soil then have at it with hydroponics!!  If you understand the scientific language you'll be able to get a great start via the internet.  I am just saying, if you aren't prolific with plants in soil, you should start there first.  Become very knowledgeable with soil and plants.  You asked for opinions and that is mine.  \n",
